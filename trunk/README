About Route-Nova Zip-code
-----------
Zip-code is a library for calculating the distance between two zip
codes and finding all the records with x miles (or kilometres) of another zip code.
Currently, Zip-code support only PostgreSQL. Additional future support for other
databases will be added in future releases of Zip-code.

Zip-code is free software released under the terms of the new BSD license.
Zip-code was written in JAVA and Pg/PlSQL. It runs for testing purposes with
open-source US zip code data, that aviliable for free at http://www.populardata.com
in CSV format. 

The distance calculations are made by doing a great circle calculation on 
longitude and latitude points provided by the census data.
The result is returned in kilometres or standard miles.

Full information about the installation of Zip-code can be found in the INSTALL
file in this directory.
